# 🏗️ SCRIPT ORGANIZATION ANALYSIS

## 🤔 **WHERE SHOULD backtest_regimes.py GO?**

### **Current Location:** `scripts/backtest_regimes.py`

### **Two Use Cases for This Script:**

#### 🔄 **1. OPTIMIZATION USE (Future Re-optimization)**
- Called by `optimization/run_focused_sweep.py`
- Used to evaluate different parameter combinations
- Part of the parameter tuning workflow
- **Argument:** Should go in `optimization/`

#### 🏭 **2. PRODUCTION USE (Live Trading Validation)**
- Used to validate live signal performance
- Backtest individual days/weeks with current parameters
- Ongoing performance monitoring
- **Argument:** Should stay in `scripts/` (production tools)

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: KEEP IN `scripts/`**

### **Why `scripts/` is Better:**

✅ **Dual Purpose Tool**
- Used for both optimization AND production validation
- Not exclusively an optimization tool

✅ **Consistent with Signal Generation**
- `rolling_gex_regimes.py` (signal generation) is in `scripts/`
- `backtest_regimes.py` (signal evaluation) logically belongs together
- They're a **matched pair** for signal workflow

✅ **Production Workflow**
```bash
# Generate signals
python scripts/rolling_gex_regimes.py --ticker SPY --date 20250917 --csv Y

# Evaluate signals  
python scripts/backtest_regimes.py --regimes_dir ./results --symbols SPY
```

✅ **Optimization Calls Into Scripts**
- `optimization/` scripts call `scripts/` for core functionality
- This is the correct dependency direction
- Optimization is higher-level, scripts are core tools

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW LOGIC**

### **Optimization Workflow:**
```
optimization/run_focused_sweep.py
    ↓ calls
scripts/rolling_gex_regimes.py (generate signals with different params)
    ↓ calls  
scripts/backtest_regimes.py (evaluate signal performance)
    ↓ results to
optimization/combine_scoreboards_final.py
```

### **Production Workflow:**
```
scripts/rolling_gex_regimes.py (generate today's signals)
    ↓ 
scripts/backtest_regimes.py (validate last week's performance)
```

---

## ✅ **CONCLUSION: KEEP backtest_regimes.py IN scripts/**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Core production tool** used beyond just optimization
2. **Logical pairing** with signal generation script
3. **Correct dependency hierarchy** (optimization calls scripts, not vice versa)
4. **Cleaner separation** between core tools vs. optimization framework
